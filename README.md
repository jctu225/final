Learnly

Learnly is a mock website I am building to demonstrate the skills I have built in HTML/CSS/Javascrip/PHP

The conception of the site is that a person completes lessons through reading, taking quizzes, and receiving trophies/experience for each lesson completed.

The site should be a simple make up of the elements found on other learning sites, used for review instead of normal study. Instead of having multiple pages per chapter, and an entirely seperate page for the quizzes I intend on placing it all on the same page.
